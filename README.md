## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 20-year-old future-focused developer passionate about building innovative and impactful digital solutions. I'm currently sharpening my skills through a 9-week intensive full-stack bootcamp with **FNB App Academy**, where I'm learning how to build modern, responsive web applications from scratch.

With a background in video editing, leadership, and customer service, I bring creativity, attention to detail, and great communication to every team and project I join. I'm also fascinated by the power of AI and how it's reshaping tech, and I’m eager to explore how it can make development smarter and more human-centered.
